    "This type of problem can be considered a supervised regression problem. This is because we are trying to use existing features of real estate like the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the location, the amenities (nightlife is mentioned), and more to predict the market value of the property. Since the market value is a continuous, numerical value and we will be using numerous examples to which the ground truth (the market value) is available, this problem can be considered both a regression and supervised machine learning problem.\n",
